# 6S Success Current Operating Status

> Living operational state for Claude Code and all 6S Success autonomous agents.

## Document Role

`STATUS.md` is the fastest authoritative summary of **what is happening now**.

It is not a strategy document, backlog, changelog, incident archive, or analytics database.

Every agent performing meaningful autonomous work should read this file after `CLAUDE.md` and `AUTONOMY.md`.

Update this file whenever the material operating state changes.

---

# 1. Status Metadata

**Last Updated:** 2026-08-19  
**Updated By:** Claude, autonomous operator pass  
**Overall Status:** RED  
**Production Confidence:** 6s-success.com STILL SERVES A HOSTINGER PARKED PAGE. THE SITE IS DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED CORRECT ON THE VPS (10 OF 10 CHECKS, PER OPS/NIGHTLY-LOG.MD 2026-08-18), BUT THE DOMAIN DOES NOT ROUTE TO IT YET. THE REMAINING STEP IS A NGINX PROXY MANAGER HOST ENTRY, WHICH NO SESSION SO FAR HAS HAD ACCESS TO. SEE DEPLOY-VPS.MD.  
**Data Confidence:** MEASURED FROM DISK AND GITHUB. NO CUSTOMER, REVENUE, OR TRAFFIC DATA EXISTS YET.

> Live figures are generated, not typed. See `EXECUTIVE-DASHBOARD-LIVE.md` and
> `ops/dashboard.html`, produced by `ops/dashboard.py`. Re-run that script rather
> than editing numbers by hand.

**Why RED:** the business cannot accept money. Checkout is staged, there is no
email provider so the email list is empty, and the site is not deployed. All 14
forms now hand off to a prefilled email instead of silently discarding input,
which stopped visitors being lost without a trace, but nothing is actually
captured yet. That single fact outranks everything else on this page.

Status values:

- `GREEN` = operating normally
- `YELLOW` = degraded, uncertain, blocked, or requires attention
- `RED` = material failure or immediate risk
- `INITIALIZING` = system is still establishing authoritative state
- `UNKNOWN` = insufficient evidence

Never mark something GREEN merely because no problem has been reported.

---

# 2. Executive Snapshot

## Current Objective

Get the business able to take money, then turn on the demand it already owns.

The operating foundation is now in place: the repository is consolidated and
private, 14 agents are installed at user scope, and the P0 safety and IP pass is
substantially complete. The constraint has moved from "can Claude work safely" to
"can a customer pay".

Standing objective from the owner (2026-08-16): develop all content and products
continuously and iteratively toward $20,000 per month, without stopping for
approval, while keeping this file and the executive dashboard current enough to
be read at a glance each morning.

## Current Business Goal

Build a trusted 6S Success digital business that helps customers improve rooms and micro-zones through desired-function discovery, root-cause diagnosis, quests, standards, products, and sustainment.

Long-term commercial target:

**$20,000+ monthly revenue**, pursued through real customer value rather than artificial activity or deceptive conversion tactics.

## Current Highest-Level Priority

**Close the money path.** In order, current state noted against each:

1. Deploy the site so the domain reaches it. Package public, compose deployed,
   DNS pointed at the VPS, all done in the 2026-08-18 desk pass. One step
   remains: a Nginx Proxy Manager host entry forwarding `6s-success.com` to the
   site container. No session so far has had access to that panel. See
   `DEPLOY-VPS.md`.
2. Give the 14 site forms somewhere real to send a submission. Interim state
   shipped 2026-08-17: all 14 hand off to a prefilled `mailto:` link instead of
   discarding input, so intent is no longer silently lost, but nothing is
   captured or listed yet. A verified working mailbox exists
   (`support@6s-success.com`), which lets server-side capture happen without a
   paid provider once the site is actually deployed and can run that code.
   Issue #11 defers buying an email platform until there is a list to send to.
3. Stand up hosted checkout for the two products that are already finished: the
   ebook and the Micro Zone Field Manual.
4. Consider a shorter lead magnet than the current 40 MB free sample PDF, or
   lead with the 0.8 MB EPUB instead. Under decision in issue #14.

The book already links to the site: all 50 chapters carry a companion resources
link to `6s-success.com/resources`, added 2026-08-16.

Everything else, including the games line, the video series and the app, waits
behind those four.

### Completed since 2026-08-16

- Repository consolidated and made private; the complete-book PDF is no longer
  publicly downloadable from GitHub.
- Safety disclaimer injected estate-wide: 50/50 chapters, the Field Manual, the
  decks, the board games, the product appendix and the app prototype.
- Website legal surface built: privacy, terms, accessibility and safety notice,
  linked from all 13 pages. Dead links went from 24 to 0, and remain at 0.
- Two physical-safety defects fixed in the book (Ch 45 power tools, Ch 50 propane).
- 945 uses of the rejected term "Set in Order" swept to "Straighten".
- Amazon trademark removed from card EE-001 text and filenames.
- Site fonts: 14 missing real weights installed, ending faux bold, and the last
  third-party request removed. The site now makes zero external calls.
- All 14 site forms wired to a prefilled email handoff instead of discarding
  input (2026-08-17).
- Free sample PDF cut from 50.7 MB to 40.0 MB with no quality loss, and stopped
  claiming to be "The Complete Book" when it holds chapters 1 to 30 of 50
  (2026-08-17).
- Cart fixed to hand off what a customer actually selected, and the shop page
  stopped marketing 34 of 41 catalogued products, including two featured on the
  homepage, as available to buy when none has a supplier, a build, or a
  platform behind it yet. They now read "In development" and link to an
  honest interest form (2026-08-19).
- Site deployed to the Hostinger VPS: image published to `ghcr.io`, compose
  pasted and two silent faults fixed, DNS pointed at the VPS. The domain still
  does not reach it; see priority 1 above (2026-08-18).

# 12. Product Portfolio Status

Current strategic product concepts may include:

- Entryway digital deck
- Entryway physical deck
- room decks
- micro-zone mini decks
- digital quests
- printable resources
- labels / visual controls
- room reset kits
- organization components
- Gridfinity / 3D-printed modules
- premium digital functionality
- services

These are **concept/product-family context**, not proof that every item is live.

`PRODUCT-CATALOG.md` must distinguish:

- concept
- prototype
- beta
- active
- paused
- retired

Do not market a concept as an available product.

---

# 13. Content Portfolio Status

Known strategic content architecture includes:

**Home**
→ **Rooms**
→ **Micro-Zones**
→ **Desired Functions**
→ **Root Causes**
→ **6S Activities**
→ **Quests**
→ **Standards**
→ **Products / Kits**
→ **Sustainment**

Current production coverage is UNKNOWN until audited.

`CONTENT-CATALOG.md` should become the authoritative content inventory.

---

# 14. Active Major Workstreams

WIP limit from `CLAUDE.md`:

**Maximum 3 major active workstreams unless deliberately changed.**

## Workstream 1: Autonomous Operating Foundation

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Owner:** `6s-ceo` / system bootstrap  
**Objective:** Establish governance, state, metrics, decision memory, operating loops, and executive visibility.

Current work:

- `CLAUDE.md` created
- `AUTONOMY.md` created
- `STATUS.md` created
- remaining core operating documents pending

Exit condition:

Core operating system can identify current state, authority, priorities, measurement, and next actions without reconstructing strategy each session.

---

## Workstream 2: GitHub / Production Control Plane

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Owners:** `github-manager`, `devops-sre`, `vps-docker-manager`  
**Objective:** Establish verified source-to-production traceability and safe autonomous delivery.

Current work:

- GitHub Manager role created
- VPS/Docker Manager role created
- DevOps/SRE role updated
- actual repository/runtime discovery still required

Exit condition:

A release can be traced from requirement through GitHub to the exact production artifact, with health checks and rollback.

---

## Workstream 3: Data / Executive Visibility

**Status:** PLANNED / DISCOVERY  
**Owners:** `analytics-intelligence`, `6s-ceo`  
**Objective:** Establish authoritative near-real-time business/product/reliability metrics and executive dashboard.

Required:

- `METRICS.md`
- `DATA-SOURCES.md`
- `DASHBOARD.md`
- live data connectors
- executive dashboard implementation
- `EXECUTIVE-BRIEF.md`

Exit condition:

Owner can see trusted current business and system health without manually gathering data.

---

# 15. Current Experiments

No experiment should be treated as active until its implementation and measurement are verified.

| Experiment | Status | Owner | Primary Metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| None verified in this status file | NONE VERIFIED | - | - |

Active experiments should also be tracked in `EXPERIMENTS.md`.

---

# 16. Current Incidents

**No incident status has yet been verified.**

This does **not** mean there are no incidents.

Production inspection is required.

When an incident is active, record:

- ID
- severity
- start
- impact
- coordinator
- current state
- mitigation
- next update

Historical incidents belong in `INCIDENTS.md`.

---

# 17. Current Blockers

## BLOCKER-001: Production State Not Yet Verified

Impact:

Autonomous agents cannot safely assume production architecture, health, release identity, backup state, or rollback capability.

Owners:

- `vps-docker-manager`
- `devops-sre`
- `github-manager`

Resolution:

Perform read-only discovery first.

---

## BLOCKER-002: Live Business Data Not Yet Established

Impact:

Claude cannot responsibly optimize toward revenue/customer metrics without trusted measurement.

Owners:

- `analytics-intelligence`
- `commerce-manager`
- `seo-aeo`

Resolution:

Create metric definitions and data-source map, then connect authoritative sources.

---

## BLOCKER-003: Executive Dashboard Not Yet Established

Impact:

Owner lacks one trusted near-real-time view of business, product, growth, and production.

Owners:

- `analytics-intelligence`
- `6s-ceo`

Resolution:

Define `DASHBOARD.md`, then implement live dashboard.

---

# 18. Known Risks

## RISK-001: Autonomous Action Without Verified State

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** OPEN

Risk:

Agents may modify systems based on assumptions.

Control:

Read current state and inspect actual systems before meaningful production action.

---

## RISK-002: Production / GitHub Drift

**Severity:** HIGH UNTIL VERIFIED  
**Status:** OPEN

Risk:

Production may not match repository configuration.

Control:

Map deployed commit/image/configuration to GitHub.

---

## RISK-003: Unknown Backup / Restore Readiness

**Severity:** HIGH UNTIL VERIFIED  
**Status:** OPEN

Risk:

Production data may not be recoverable.

Control:

Inventory persistent data, backup mechanism, off-host copy, and restore procedure.

---

## RISK-004: Optimization Without Trusted Metrics

**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Status:** OPEN

Risk:

Autonomous agents may optimize vanity or incorrectly calculated metrics.

Control:

Create `METRICS.md` and `DATA-SOURCES.md`.

---

# 19. Pending RED Decisions

None currently recorded.

If a RED action requires owner approval, record it here:

## RED-XXX

**Requested Action:**  
**Reason:**  
**Evidence:**  
**Risk:**  
**Recovery:**  
**Alternatives:**  
**Approval Status:** PENDING

Do not clutter this section with routine YELLOW coordination.

# 22. Agent Startup Checklist

Before significant autonomous work:

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Read `AUTONOMY.md`
- [ ] Read `STATUS.md`
- [ ] Identify owning agent
- [ ] Check active workstreams
- [ ] Check blockers
- [ ] Check risks
- [ ] Inspect real system state when relevant
- [ ] Classify action GREEN / YELLOW / RED
- [ ] Avoid duplicating active work

---

# 23. Status Update Rules

Update this file when any of the following materially changes:

- production health
- deployed release
- active major workstream
- incident state
- major blocker
- material risk
- executive priority
- live data confidence
- GitHub control-plane health
- VPS/Docker health
- backup/restore confidence
- major product launch state

Do not update it for every commit.

---

# 24. How to Update Status

For each changed section:

1. obtain evidence
2. change status
3. add concise evidence/notes
4. update timestamp
5. identify owner if action remains
6. move historical detail to the appropriate long-term file

Do not allow this document to become an archive.

---

# 25. Freshness

Operational status decays quickly.

Agents should treat old status as a hypothesis when the underlying system can be inspected.

For highly dynamic information such as:

- production health
- container health
- current release
- incidents
- active PRs
- traffic
- revenue

prefer live sources over stale Markdown.

Update this summary afterward.

---

# 26. Truth Hierarchy

When this file conflicts with verified live state:

**Verified live state wins.**

Then update this file.

When two live sources conflict:

1. identify authoritative source from `DATA-SOURCES.md`
2. investigate discrepancy
3. report confidence
4. do not fabricate reconciliation

---

# 27. Status Ownership

Each specialist maintains its domain truth.

`github-manager`
→ GitHub/release status

`vps-docker-manager`
→ Hostinger/Docker runtime status

`devops-sre`
→ reliability/incident status

`analytics-intelligence`
→ business/product measurement confidence

`seo-aeo`
→ organic discovery status

`commerce-manager`
→ commerce status

`product-manager`
→ customer/product journey status

`6s-ceo`
→ strategic priority and executive synthesis

---

# 28. Executive Escalation

Surface to the owner when:

- production is RED
- significant customer data is at risk
- payment integrity is at risk
- a RED authorization is required
- recovery capability is materially compromised
- a major strategic decision is blocked
- a material financial/legal commitment is required

Do not escalate routine GREEN work.

---

# 29. Desired Future State

This file should eventually be generated largely from trusted system state.

Target pattern:

**GitHub + VPS + Analytics + Commerce + Search + Product Events**
→ **Metrics / Status Collection**
→ **STATUS.md summary**
→ **Executive Dashboard**
→ **6s-ceo prioritization**
→ **BACKLOG.md**
→ **Autonomous execution**

Human edits should not be required for routine status maintenance.

---

# 30. Current Overall Assessment

**Operating System:** INITIALIZING

**Governance:** STRONG FOUNDATION

**Autonomous Execution Readiness:** PARTIAL

**Production Knowledge:** INSUFFICIENTLY VERIFIED

**Business Data Knowledge:** INSUFFICIENTLY VERIFIED

**Executive Visibility:** NOT YET COMPLETE

**Immediate Focus:** Establish verified business and production truth before allowing broad autonomous optimization.

---

# Final Rule

`STATUS.md` must describe reality, not aspiration.

If something is unknown, write `UNKNOWN`.

If something is degraded, write `YELLOW`.

If something is broken, write `RED`.

If something is healthy, prove it.

The purpose of this file is to let every autonomous agent answer:

**Where are we now, what matters most, and what should happen next?**
