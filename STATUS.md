# 6S Success Current Operating Status

> Living operational state for Claude Code and all 6S Success autonomous agents.

## Document Role

`STATUS.md` is the fastest authoritative summary of **what is happening now**.

It is not a strategy document, backlog, changelog, incident archive, or analytics database.

Every agent performing meaningful autonomous work should read this file after `CLAUDE.md` and `AUTONOMY.md`.

Update this file whenever the material operating state changes.

# 1. Status Metadata

**Last Updated:** 2026-09-17, scheduled operator cycle (this one). **Ran the one check no cycle had run today, `preflight.py --deep`, to completion; clean, no new defect.** Attached via unshallow plus ff-only merge onto `origin/main` (`7a4874a2`), clean, 382-commit fast-forward. Every standing lane confirmed exhausted rather than cited: 7 GitHub issues live via the API, unchanged, all `decision`/`blocked-on-art`; no mail credential; `curl` to `6s-success.com` and `api.stripe.com` both denied by the sandbox proxy, confirmed directly. Grepped this log for `--deep` under today's date and found none, so ran it in the background to real completion (not foreground-killed): every gate passed, 22 warnings, all previously diagnosed sandbox limits, 0 new; `gate_visual_audit`'s 193-page sweep found nothing. Checked the dashboard regen this run itself caused (several `ops/state.json` fields a prior local session's egress had populated dropped to null/0/unreachable) against the rendered `EXECUTIVE-DASHBOARD-LIVE.md` rather than assume it was harmless: the carry-forward machinery states each one honestly ("carried forward... because this run could not reach Stripe", "unconfirmed on the live site"), not a silent zero, so no regression. No code, content, price or product touched. IndexNow not applicable.

**Prior (2026-09-17, PM check-in):** **Previous work confirmed finished (preflight clean, 22 warnings, all previously diagnosed); dashboard regenerated honestly with real carry-forward notes since this sandbox cannot reach Stripe/analytics/the live site; the `ops/*.py` mention-count cold-read lane confirmed exhausted a further time and handed off in favour of a fresh lane (cross-checking hand-authored `site/*.html` pages against current catalog/deck facts, the method that just found two real defects on `invest.html`/`book.html`).**

**Prior (2026-09-17, scheduled operator cycle):** **Previous work confirmed finished; no new closeable item; the deploy gap reopened and the command deck now reflects it.** Attached via unshallow plus ff-only merge onto `origin/main` (`c7659827`), clean. `preflight.py` full run: every gate passed, 22 warnings, all previously diagnosed sandbox limits. 7 GitHub issues confirmed live via the API, unchanged, all `decision`/`blocked-on-art`. No mail credential, `inbox_agent.py --apply` UNCHECKED not empty. `BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md` sections 2-6 again all done or Phil-gated. Recomputed the `ops/*.py` cold-read floor fresh (still 11 mentions in `ops/NIGHTLY-LOG.md`) and read three of its files end to end, running each rather than trusting the docstring: `generated_products.py` (149 sellable products, every deliverable file present and a plausible size, no defect), `import_room_images.py` (the shrink-protection `reconcile()` this file depends on is independently proven every run by `gate_room_images_stable`, no defect), `wire_signup.py` (confirmed still correctly withdrawn pending issue #15, already diagnosed and gated 2026-09-09 by `gate_no_stale_listmonk_blocker`, nothing new). **Real, if unglamorous, finding: production has drifted behind the repository again.** `ops/deploy-verdict.json` last confirmed current at `2026-09-17T14:54:54Z` (build `6c155b8b48679497`); two more commits have since touched `site/` (`9a4b37c5`, `c7659827`, the latter Phil's own www-to-apex redirect), moving `site/build-id.txt` to `4e2e23713c5a4e6e`. `ops/state.json` already correctly reads `deploy_verdict: stale` (the carry-forward machinery worked), and this morning's `gate_hourly_brief_deploy_staleness` fix means Phil's own hourly mail will now name this in the subject line rather than needing a session to notice it by hand. No VPS access in this sandbox, so nothing to run; regenerated the command deck (`ops/dashboard.py`), which now correctly leads with the redeploy instruction again instead of the discovery framing it carried this morning. No code, content, price or product touched. IndexNow not applicable.

**Prior (2026-09-17, PM check-in):** Attached via unshallow plus ff-only merge onto `origin/main`, clean, no unrelated-history symptom. `preflight.py` run backgrounded rather than foreground-killed (per this log's own standing lesson): every gate passed, 22 warnings, all previously diagnosed sandbox limits (no egress, no Stripe/mail credential, no Pillow, no ssh key). Working tree clean before and after. `STATUS.md` checked against the latest log entry: current, no drift.

**Prior (2026-09-17, scheduled operator cycle): "the deploy gap is an operating-loop failure... nothing routed the one actor able to act to the one line saying to act."** Production had sat behind the repository for a stretch spanning two customer-facing trust fixes while `ops/state.json` read `deploy_verdict: stale` and the dashboard's own regenerated text said "Redeploy the site," and every session, including the one that eventually deployed, read past it, because nothing put that line in front of anyone on a schedule. `ops/hourly_brief.py`, the one automated, credentialed mail Phil actually reads hourly, already does this exact routing for a dead payment link (`gate_hourly_brief_payment_links`, 2026-09-09) and had never been extended to the identical shape for a stale deploy. New `deploy_staleness_summary(st)` reads the `deploy_verdict`/`deploy_verified_at`/`deploy_carried` fields `ops/dashboard.py`'s `resolve_deploy_verdict()` already writes to `ops/state.json`; a confirmed mismatch (`deploy_verdict == "stale"`) now prepends `PRODUCTION BEHIND REPOSITORY -` to the mail's SUBJECT line and adds a DEPLOY section naming when it was last confirmed matching and what fixes it (a Redeploy click, or a session with VPS access running `ops/deploy.py`); `"unknown"` stays non-urgent, since it is usually just nobody with VPS access having measured recently, not evidence of anything wrong, per `CLAUDE.md` 0.4. This job holds no deploy key, so it can only route the message, not act on it, same limit as every sibling Stripe check in this file. New `gate_hourly_brief_deploy_staleness` in `ops/preflight.py`, same shape as `gate_hourly_brief_payment_links`: proves all four verdict branches (current/stale/unknown/no-reading) and that a confirmed-stale reading reaches both the SUBJECT line and the mail body; fail-then-pass proved directly (planted the exact regression, dropping the subject-line wiring while leaving the summary function intact, watched the gate fail by name citing the real subject line it produced, restored, reran clean). Full `preflight.py` after (every gate passed, 22 warnings, all previously diagnosed sandbox limits), `check_urls.py` (188/188), `audit_pages.py` (0 dup), `affiliate.py --check` (162 documents), `fix_dashes.py --check` (0/0) all clean. Previewed the real `ops/hourly_brief.py --preview` end to end: with production currently confirmed current (`2026-09-17T14:54:54Z`, this morning's deploy), the DEPLOY section correctly reads OK, not a manufactured alarm. No price or product touched, no site page changed, IndexNow not applicable: this is an internal ops-mail generator, not a published page. 7 GitHub issues confirmed live via the API, unchanged, all `decision`/`blocked-on-art`, 0 open PRs.

**Older entries (40 of them, 2026-08 to 2026-09-17) live in `STATUS-ARCHIVE.md`.** Moved there 2026-09-17: section 1 had grown to 44 stacked entries and 151 KB, 75% of this file, which every session reads in full before doing any work. Nothing was deleted, and the gates that scan this file for stale claims (`gate_no_stale_session_label`, `gate_no_stale_checkout_count`, `gate_no_stale_listmonk_blocker`, `gate_corporate_buy_path_current`, `gate_critical_risks_escalated`) now scan the archive too, so an archived claim is no less checked than a current one.

# 2. Executive Snapshot

## Current Objective

The money path now works well enough to test. The constraint has moved again,
from "can a customer pay" to "can anything be measured, and has a stranger
ever converted". `ROADMAP-2026-2029.md` (written 2026-08-24) is the current
authoritative strategy; it supersedes `ROADMAP.md`, `STRATEGY.md` and
`GROWTH-PLAN.md` in spirit even though those files still exist on disk.
`BACKLOG-2026-H2.md` is the current authoritative work queue and supersedes
`BACKLOG.md` as a list of what to do next.

Standing objective from the owner (2026-08-16): develop all content and products
continuously and iteratively toward $20,000 per month, without stopping for
approval, while keeping this file and the executive dashboard current enough to
be read at a glance each morning.

**The honest arithmetic, from `ROADMAP-2026-2029.md`:** the digital catalogue
cannot reach $20,000 a month on any reachable traffic (the $19 item alone needs
roughly a quarter million visits a month). Services (In-Home Reset Day at
$1,200) reach the number on far fewer bookings but consume Phil's own hours and
have not been demand-tested beyond one referral. Horizon 1 (now through August
2027) is about proving a stranger converts at all, with an honest revenue
target of $500 to $3,000 a month by month twelve, not $20,000.

## Current Business Goal

Build a trusted 6S Success digital business that helps customers improve rooms and micro-zones through desired-function discovery, root-cause diagnosis, quests, standards, products, and sustainment.

Long-term commercial target:

**$20,000+ monthly revenue**, pursued through real customer value rather than artificial activity or deceptive conversion tactics.

## Current Highest-Level Priority

**The ordering rule in `BACKLOG-2026-H2.md`: measurement before traffic, traffic
before conversion, conversion before product.** Current state against each
epic:

1. **Epic 1, measurement (blocks everything).** EXP-001 (has a stranger ever
   clicked a buy button) is answered, permanently: AMBIGUOUS (backlog 1.3,
   closed 2026-09-03). EXP-002 (does anyone reach the offer on a zone page)
   is still collecting scroll-depth data. Umami read access is partly done:
   Phil read the database directly 2026-09-02 and recorded a one-time
   baseline in `GOALS.md`, but no environment this operator runs in has a
   live credential, so that baseline cannot be refreshed or queried for
   EXP-002 without Phil re-pulling it by hand. The single highest-value item
   outstanding is a share URL or API key so an operator session can pull it
   directly (backlog item 1.2).
2. **Epic 2, broken or dishonest.** The real blocker is the shared Listmonk
   sending identity (issue #15, P0): a 6S signup currently would receive mail
   branded as a different company, so every signup surface on the site
   (footer and in-body) has been deliberately withdrawn rather than shipped
   half-honest. The email list is 0 and stays 0 until this is decided.
3. **Epic 3, traffic.** Search is the only durable, no-audience-required route
   and it takes 12 to 18 months to compound; Nova Consulting has no list to
   borrow. Issue #22 was closed 2026-08-25 (Phil's own session reached the
   site and IndexNow directly), but this operator's sandboxed network still
   returns http_code 000 for both on re-test the same day, so newly
   published pages still cannot be submitted to IndexNow from every session
   even though the ten already-written LinkedIn posts and image prompts are
   ready and waiting on Phil to publish/generate.
4. **Epic 4, conversion.** Deliberately not started; nothing here is
   interpretable until epic 1 lands.
5. **Epic 5, product.** The catalog is not short of products, it is short of
   visitors. Nothing here starts before epic 1 answers whether the funnel
   works at all.

Commerce was largely solved, then broke silently, then was fixed: 158 of 159
catalog items have a Stripe Payment Link or a real free download behind them
(widened from 10 on 2026-08-27, Phil's own Stripe sync); all six links the
live site actually served were found deactivated on 2026-08-30 and
reactivated and verified working by Phil on 2026-08-31 (see "Why this was
RED, and why it is YELLOW now" above). What is still unconfirmed is whether
the deployed site itself carries the rest of the repository's fixes and
current catalog and pricing. **Corrected 2026-09-11, operator: the "7 of 9
homepage assets behind" figure this paragraph cited is stale and no longer
what the dashboard measures** (`EXECUTIVE-DASHBOARD-LIVE.md` today reads
"could not be reached from here... treat public reachability as unverified,
not confirmed," not a specific stale-asset count); that number was last real
around 2026-08-31 and nobody re-derived this citation after the dashboard's
own measurement changed shape, the same "source corrected, artifact never
re-derived" defect class this file names throughout. The "Redeploy click"
framing is also superseded: `OWNER-ACTIONS.md` item 1 records the VPS SSH
deploy key installed 2026-09-01 ("No deploy needs you again"), so Hostinger's
manual click is no longer the mechanism. What has NOT been verified since:
whether any operator session has ever actually held the private half of that
key. Every sandboxed cycle since, this one included, reports "no deploy key
at /root/.ssh/6s_deploy," and no workflow in `.github/workflows/` runs
`ops/deploy.py`, so no automated pipeline exercises it either. Whether the
live site has been redeployed even once since 2026-09-01, by Phil's own hand
or otherwise, is genuinely unknown from here, not merely "not measured this
run." Treat deploy freshness as unconfirmed by design until either a session
holding the key checks directly or Phil confirms he deploys manually.

### Completed since 2026-08-16

- Repository consolidated and made private; the complete-book PDF is no longer
  publicly downloadable from GitHub.
- Safety disclaimer injected estate-wide: 50/50 chapters, the Field Manual, the
  decks, the board games, the product appendix and the app prototype.
- Website legal surface built: privacy, terms, accessibility and safety notice,
  linked from all 13 pages. Dead links went from 24 to 0, and remain at 0.
- Two physical-safety defects fixed in the book (Ch 45 power tools, Ch 50 propane).
- 945 uses of the rejected term "Set in Order" swept to "Straighten".
- Amazon trademark removed from card EE-001 text and filenames.
- Site fonts: 14 missing real weights installed, ending faux bold, and the last
  third-party request removed. The site now makes zero external calls.
- All 14 site forms wired to a prefilled email handoff instead of discarding
  input (2026-08-17).
- Free sample PDF cut from 50.7 MB to 40.0 MB with no quality loss, and stopped
  claiming to be "The Complete Book" when it holds chapters 1 to 30 of 50
  (2026-08-17).
- Cart fixed to hand off what a customer actually selected, and the shop page
  stopped marketing 34 of 41 catalogued products, including two featured on the
  homepage, as available to buy when none has a supplier, a build, or a
  platform behind it yet. They now read "In development" and link to an
  honest interest form (2026-08-19).
- Site deployed to the Hostinger VPS: image published to `ghcr.io`, compose
  pasted and two silent faults fixed, DNS pointed at the VPS. The domain still
  does not reach it; see priority 1 above (2026-08-18).
- Free sample's on-disk filename still read "Complete Book" after its title
  and heading were corrected, so a reader's saved file carried the false claim
  the visible link text no longer made. Renamed the HTML and PDF (site and the
  content mirror) to name what they actually are: chapters 1 to 30 (2026-08-19).
- Live Stripe account onboarded and two consulting products taken live: Virtual
  Home Consult and In-Home Reset Day, both real Payment Links (2026-08-19).
- The consulting page's own primary "Book a consult" button sent buyers to a
  contact form instead of the live packages just below it, the exact page
  built to sell something that can now actually be bought. Repointed it to the
  packages section, and corrected `ops/dashboard.py`'s payment detection,
  which only looked for an embedded checkout script and so still reported
  "cannot take money" after the Payment Links went live (2026-08-19).
- Phil synced the 149 generated zone/room/kit/bundle packs to live Stripe
  himself and wired `window.CATALOG`, widening the buyable catalog from 10
  to 158 of 159 SKUs, and fixed the EPUB builder's hardcoded author
  placeholder that had blocked Amazon KDP submission (both 2026-08-27).
- Phil built a retail affiliate link layer (`ops/affiliate.py`,
  `ops/affiliate-accounts.json`, 10 programmes tracked), a compliance gate
  wired into `fulfil-orders.yml` (no affiliate link may ship inside a PDF,
  EPUB or other delivered document; disclosure must sit above any tracked
  link), and primary-sourced research on all 10 programmes, emailed to
  himself as a decision dossier (2026-08-28). No programme is applied to
  yet; opening an account requires his own legal/tax identity, so this is
  entirely his next step, not operator-actionable. The dossier's headline:
  do not apply to Amazon yet (a 180-day, 3-sale rule would likely burn the
  Associates ID permanently at current traffic), Wayfair's Creator terms
  forbid the only surfaces this site has, and Etsy/Office Depot/Home Depot
  legacy look like the best near-term fits.
- Phil found and fixed a live payment outage (all 6 Stripe links the site
  served were deactivated, invisible to every repository-level check for at
  least 3 days), added `ops/check_live_links.py` to catch it going forward,
  corrected terms/delivery-time/privacy copy that would have shipped
  publicly false statements on the same deploy, and hardened the deploy
  path itself (nginx config now validated in CI before publish, timeouts
  added to three proxied locations) (2026-08-30, `retro/RETRO-2026-08-30-cycle6.md`).
- Phil put each of the 109 sellable zone packs on its own zone page ($4 for
  6 cards, beside the existing $19 whole-house pack), closing the gap where
  the only pages that create demand for the long tail never linked to it
  (2026-08-30).
- One product, one card count: the Entryway deck was advertised as 46, 88
  and 90 cards in different places; corrected everywhere to the real 88, and
  `gate_deck_count` now checks it on every build (2026-08-30, Phil).
- The eight day payment outage closed: all six live Stripe payment links
  reactivated and verified working in a real browser, the same measurement
  that had reported them dead now reports the site can take money again
  (2026-08-31, Phil, `b0e9462`, `84c04cc`). The deployed site itself is
  still an older build than the repository; see the redeploy note above.

# 9. Business Metrics

Owner: `analytics-intelligence`

The values below must come from authoritative sources.

Do not manually estimate them.

**No live Stripe, Umami or Search Console credential exists in this operator
sandbox.** The revenue and order figures below are the one measurement
recorded in `ROADMAP-2026-2029.md`, not a live pull, and will not update again
until a session has real Stripe read access. **Corrected 2026-09-02:** Sessions
and organic sessions are no longer UNKNOWN. The Umami API token is expired
(401 on every route), but Phil's own session read the analytics database
directly on 2026-09-02 and recorded real numbers in `GOALS.md`, which is now
the authoritative source for these two rows. That was a one-time manual pull,
not a wired live feed: this sandbox still cannot refresh it, so treat it as
current as of 2026-09-02 and re-pull by the same means when it goes stale.
Everything else genuinely has no measurement source yet and stays UNKNOWN
rather than being estimated.

|---|---|---|
| Commerce platform | LARGELY LIVE | 158 of 159 catalog items take a card directly through a Stripe Payment Link, real downloads for free ones. Corporate Lean 6S is priced-per-engagement by design, not gapless: `site/corporate.html` (Phil, commit `9e7b1cd1`, 2026-09-03) gives it a qualified-enquiry buy path ending in a written scope and fixed fee, deliberately with no self-serve checkout since two engagements with the same headcount can be very different weeks of work. This row still read "no buy path" as of 2026-09-05, corrected here 2026-09-06 after `GOALS.md` and `REVENUE-REVIEW-2026-09-04.md` were found with the same stale claim. Catalog widened from 10 to 159 SKUs on 2026-08-27 when Phil wired the 149 generated zone/room/kit/bundle packs to live Stripe products himself (commit `b10a278`, backlog 5.7). |
| Payment provider | LIVE | Stripe, acct_1U5rDs6OlZmKL8mF, charges and payouts enabled since 2026-08-19. One real transaction cleared 2026-08-21 ($19, $18.15 net), a personal referral, not a stranger. MCP connection is read only; writes go through reviewed scripts (`ops/stripe_catalog.py`, `ops/stripe_setup.py`, `ops/stripe_links.py`). |
| Checkout health | UNVERIFIED THIS SESSION | `buy.stripe.com` is unreachable from this operator session's sandboxed network (still http_code 000 on re-test 2026-08-27), though issue #22 was closed 2026-08-25 after Phil's own session reached the live site directly. Egress is inconsistent across sessions, not uniformly fixed. One real order completing on 2026-08-21 is the strongest evidence checkout works end to end. |
| Product catalog | 158 of 159 SKUs buyable | Corporate Lean 6S is quote-per-engagement, not gapless: see the commerce platform row above. Card decks (issue #20) closed 2026-09-15: one free 88-card deck, no paid tier, pending sales evidence, not an open decision. See `6S_SUCCESS_PRODUCT-CATALOG.md` and `PRODUCT-CATALOG.md`. |
| Digital fulfillment | WORKING | The one recorded sale (Whole House Print Pack) fulfilled unattended in about ten minutes per `ROADMAP-2026-2029.md`. |
| Physical fulfillment | N/A | Nothing physical is sold; consulting is a service |

| Tax handling | UNKNOWN | Identify current implementation |
| Refund workflow | DOCUMENTED, UNVERIFIED | `site/terms.html` states a distance-based refund schedule for bookings; no refund has been tested against live Stripe |
| Purchase analytics | 1 order, no repeat | The single 2026-08-21 sale; too small a sample to be more than a coincidence with a percentage sign, per `ROADMAP-2026-2029.md` |

# 12. Product Portfolio Status

Current strategic product concepts may include:

- Entryway digital deck
- Entryway physical deck
- room decks
- micro-zone mini decks
- digital quests
- printable resources
- labels / visual controls
- room reset kits
- organization components
- Gridfinity / 3D-printed modules
- premium digital functionality
- services

These are **concept/product-family context**, not proof that every item is live.

`PRODUCT-CATALOG.md` must distinguish:

- concept
- prototype
- beta
- active
- paused
- retired

Do not market a concept as an available product.

---

# 13. Content Portfolio Status

Known strategic content architecture includes:

**Home**
→ **Rooms**
→ **Micro-Zones**
→ **Desired Functions**
→ **Root Causes**
→ **6S Activities**
→ **Quests**
→ **Standards**
→ **Products / Kits**
→ **Sustainment**

Current production coverage is UNKNOWN until audited.

`CONTENT-CATALOG.md` should become the authoritative content inventory.

# 14. Active Major Workstreams

WIP limit from `CLAUDE.md`:

**Maximum 3 major active workstreams unless deliberately changed.**

The bootstrap-era workstreams below (governance foundation, GitHub/production
control plane, data visibility) closed out over 2026-08-16 through 08-24: all
required operating documents exist, `ops/dashboard.py` generates
`EXECUTIVE-DASHBOARD-LIVE.md` from measured state, and the site is deployed
and was verified live. Every item in `BACKLOG-2026-H2.md` epics 1 through 5
is still blocked on Phil, a decision issue, or a missing credential (see
section 21), and that file's own epic 6 (keep the operation honest) is where
most per-cycle work happened through 2026-09-06.

**Corrected 2026-09-07, this operator.** Phil gave a direct new instruction
(expand the micro zone model, the decks, and the app; recorded verbatim in
`PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md`) and `BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md` reprioritised the
whole queue around it, superseding `BACKLOG-2026-H2.md`'s ordering (that
file's process rules still hold). This is real, currently unblocked work, not
the absence this section described as of 2026-08-24; see Workstream 3 below.

## Workstream 1: Prove a stranger converts (Horizon 1, per `ROADMAP-2026-2029.md`)

**Status:** BLOCKED, not yet startable  
**Owner:** operator, gated by Phil on backlog items 1.2 and 2.1  
**Objective:** Answer whether the funnel converts anyone who was not
personally told about the site by Phil, per the roadmap's kill criterion
(fewer than 500 organic visits/month and nothing further has sold beyond
the single $19 of 2026-08-21, by August 2027).

EXP-001 is answered (permanently AMBIGUOUS, backlog 1.3). Blocked on: a
Umami share URL or API key (1.2), so EXP-002 and future funnel reads do not
depend on Phil re-pulling the database by hand each time.

---

## Workstream 2: Local demand test for service SKUs (Epic 3B)

**Status:** BLOCKED, awaiting a spending decision  
**Owner:** Phil approves, operator executes  
**Objective:** Test whether the In-Home Reset Day / Virtual Home Consult SKUs
have real non-referral demand, since they are the only route to $20,000 that
does not require quarter-million-visitor traffic.

Blocked on: 3B.1, a capped budget and stop date, correctly RED per `CLAUDE.md`
(material spending).

---

## Workstream 3: The diagnostic layer, Sustain depth, and the Kitchen deck

**Status:** ACTIVE, opened 2026-09-07  
**Owner:** operator, direction from Phil  
**Objective:** `PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md` + `BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md`
section 2/3: build the root-cause diagnostic layer the product currently
lacks (0 of 114 zones map a root cause), fix the app's first thirty seconds,
and ship the free unillustrated Kitchen deck.

**Done:** M1, the frozen 17-cause vocabulary (`ops/root_causes.py`,
`gate_root_cause_vocabulary`), corrected from the plan's own uncross-checked
"21" (a friction-card count, not a cause count). Separately this same cycle,
not part of this workstream's plan but found while verifying it: a live CI
break (three control docs' em/en dashes, plus real bugs in the fixing tool
itself) and a real generator-ownership drift (the $19 Print Pack, the live
Quest app's own data, and the mobile app's corpus all served pre-Sustain-
rewrite text after a concurrent session's content change), both fixed.

**Done 2026-09-07, operator, this cycle:** M2, the `diagnosis` schema and
validator (`ops/diagnosis.py`, `content/manual/source/validate.py` GATE 8,
`ops/tests/test_diagnosis_schema.py`). First draft flattened each friction to
one cause; corrected in the same cycle after checking it against the real
`kitchen-deck.json` FRICTION CARDs, which branch one symptom to two or three
causes. Zones without `diagnosis` still build (0 of 114 diagnosed today).
Also fixed this cycle, found by preflight at the start: `site/build-id.txt`
was stale against the prior commit's own `sw.js` regeneration, failing both
`checks.yml` and `publish-image.yml` at HEAD; fixed and both confirmed green.

**Done 2026-09-07, operator, same cycle:** M3's Kitchen half. All 7 Kitchen
zones now carry `diagnosis`, every string reused verbatim from
`ops/cardtext/kitchen-deck.json`'s own FRICTION and 15-minute ACTION cards
(0 schema problems). Entryway 5 is still open: those zones have no
equivalent card deck to reuse from, so it needs real authorship rather than
a mechanical mapping.

**Done 2026-09-07, operator, this cycle:** M3's Entryway half, and M3 is now
complete (12 of 12 pilot zones). The 5 Entryway zones carry hand-authored
`diagnosis`, since no Entryway card deck exists to reuse from; grounded
directly in each zone's own already-published `passes`/`the_call`/`watch_for`
text, every cause drawn from `ops/root_causes.py`'s frozen 17, no fact
invented. Reconciled with a concurrent session's own commit of the Kitchen
half (`3e58d480`, pushed while this cycle was in flight): rather than
re-push a conflicting `content.json`, reset onto their tip and layered only
the new Entryway zones on top, keeping their Kitchen authorship untouched.

New `gate_diagnosis_authoring` in `preflight.py` asserts, on every run, that
every Kitchen pilot zone's frictions reuse a real FRICTION CARD's `title` or
`objective` and branches character-for-character (their commit used `title`;
the gate accepts either real field, not one hardcoded guess), and scans
every diagnosed zone anywhere for a customer/reviewer attribution claim.
`ops/tests/test_diagnosis_authoring.py`, 5 cases, proves both defect classes
get caught on a planted mutation, then restores; real corpus clean.
`content/manual/source/validate.py` GATE 8: 12 of 114 zones diagnosed, 0
problems. `content.json`'s Entryway diff is a verified pure addition (259
lines, 0 changed), confirmed by a controlled round-trip before editing.

**Done 2026-09-07, operator, this cycle:** M4. `ops/build_zone_pages.py` now
renders the diagnosis block (symptom, branches, 30-second confirm test,
which pass to start at, plus the 15-minute entry) above the six passes on
all 12 pilot zone pages, adds one FAQPage Q&A per friction, and swaps their
related reading from the shared 19-link block to 3 to 5 articles chosen by
the zone's own diagnosed causes, no two of the 12 identical. Two real
grammar defects (a blanket `.lower()` and `str.capitalize()` both turning a
mid-sentence "I" into "i") caught by reading the rendered page, not by any
upstream check, and fixed before shipping. New `gate_diagnosis_rendered` in
`preflight.py` (`ops/tests/test_gate_diagnosis_rendered.py`, 8 cases) checks
render coverage, the link-count range, cross-zone uniqueness, and that exact
pronoun defect on every future run. Not checked against the live domain
itself (`CLAUDE.md` 0.3): no egress to 6s-success.com from this sandbox,
same wall every prior cycle records. Full detail in
`PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md`'s M4 row.

**Done 2026-09-07, operator, this cycle:** K0/B3, the deck card-count gate.
`gate_deck_count` counted rendered card-front PNGs to learn the deck's true
size, and returned immediately when `build/cards-rendered/` was empty, which
is every cloud run: the entire check, including every catalogue/page
comparison, silently never ran anywhere except a full local render. Rewrote
it to read `build/entryway-cardtext.json` (a committed corpus file, real in
every environment) instead, and to assert `ops/build_deck_gallery.py`'s
hardcoded `DECKS['entryway']['written']` against that corpus so the count
itself can never quietly drift. Verified a real, live defect this surfaced:
`deck.html`'s title, meta description and OG/Twitter tags said "89 cards"
with no explanation, while `data.js`, `shop.html` and the print-and-play
redirect page all said 88; fixed the six flat instances on `deck.html` to
88. Left the already-correct "72 of the deck's 89 cards are drawn" progress
sentences alone (89, the full written total, is the right denominator
there; `deck-gallery.html` already explains the 89/88 split). Also found
and corrected a stale claim in `PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md` 3.2: the "46
cards" figure it named in `ops/build_printpack.py`/`ops/build_standards.py`
no longer exists in either file, consistent with Phil's 2026-08-30 sweep;
that row was never re-read against the code after that fix landed. New
`ops/tests/test_gate_deck_count.py` (7 cases) proves the gate catches a
third-number catalogue claim and a bare wrong-number page, does not
false-positive on a CSS comment inside `<style>` (found live, a dormant
bug the never-runs gate had been hiding) or on the honest "X of Y drawn"
phrasing, and that the DECKS table matches the real corpus. `preflight.py`
confirmed clean after: every gate passed, same 15 sandbox-limitation
warnings. The 404-shop-tile half of K0 is unchanged: the referenced image
exists in this repository's own build, not the same claim as a live 200,
and this sandbox still has no egress to 6s-success.com to check that
directly.

**Next:** M4's 21-day clock starts once this is deployed and verified live.
A2 is now done (see below). M6 (diagnosis for the remaining 102 zones) stays
gated on M4's 21-day read, per the plan's own rule: do not start it early.

**A5 done, 2026-09-09, operator.** The three genuinely missing funnel events
(`quest-cause-shown`, `quest-card-abandoned`, `quest-return`) are now shipped
in `site/assets/js/quest.js`, verified by a new static gate and a real
headless-Chromium run; see `BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md`'s "A5 (funnel
instrumentation) closed" row and `PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md`'s A5 row for
the full account.

**S1-S4 re-measured, 2026-09-09, operator, rather than trusted from the
prior line's own hedge.** The prior note here was right to be suspicious:
the concurrent Sustain prose rewrite already covers most of what S1-S4 asked
for as authored content. Measured directly against `content.json`'s 114
`passes.sustain` strings: all 114 are now 87 to 106 words (median 94,
comfortably inside S2/S4's 90-to-130 target), and a rough keyword scan finds
recovery language in 102 of 114. What is still genuinely absent is the
*structured, machine-checkable* schema S1 itself asks for (a `sustain_detail`
object with six typed fields, a closed cadence list, a `drift_signal` noun
check): 0 of 114 zones carry any such field today, so S1's schema and gate
do not exist. Given the prose already answers the content gap that made S1
urgent, S1 as originally scoped (add the schema, then re-author it a second
time in structured form) reads as more product work ahead of the constraint
(`GOALS.md` rule 1: distribution beats production) rather than the
measurement-tier item it was filed as. Recommend re-scoping S1 to something
narrower before spending 0.5 to 3.5 days on it, or dropping it in favour of
Epic 3 (traffic) work; left as an open question rather than started this
cycle.

**A2 done, 2026-09-09, operator, a later cycle the same day.** "45 to 75
minutes" was still the first number a first-timer read on card one of the
classic ("show me the house instead" -> "Start at the door") path; the
symptom flow's own simplified card zero already hid it, but that path did
not. `site/assets/js/quest.js` now withholds `#c-session` on any card one of
a genuine first run (`run.i === 0 && isFirstRun()`), covering both paths with
one condition instead of two. The number moved to the finish screen instead
of disappearing: a new `#f-session` in `site/quest.html`, populated once at
least one card of a single-zone run is done, phrased against whether the
zone was just fully held. The zone page already stated it and is untouched.
Verified in a real headless-Chromium run of the classic path end to end
(card one empty, card two correctly shows "15-30 min for the whole zone, six
passes", finish screen reads "The whole zone runs about 15-30 min, all six
passes, whenever you want the rest of it."), plus the existing
`test_quest_flow.py` (symptom path) still passing unmodified. New
`gate_quest_session_placement` in `preflight.py`,
`ops/tests/test_gate_quest_session_placement.py` (6 cases, fail-then-pass
proved on both halves: the withholding and the finish-screen restatement).
`ops/fingerprint_assets.py` rerun; `site/quest.html`'s script-tag
fingerprint and `site/sw.js` follow. See `PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md`'s A2
row for the full account.

**M7/A1 found already fixed by Phil, closed against reality, 2026-09-09,
operator, a later cycle the same day.** Both rows still read as 1.5 days of
open work ("570 of 684 cards print a stop condition that card cannot
reach"). Phil's own `fa491b1a` (2026-09-07) had already fixed the actual
lie: `renderCard()` no longer heads a card "You can stop when" over the
whole-zone `done_looks_like` text, it says what the text is and where the
reader stands against it. The literal M7 acceptance criteria (a distinct
authored `victory` line per card) is still unmet and correctly unstarted;
`PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md` updated to say so. New
`gate_quest_card_victory_honesty` in `preflight.py`
(`ops/tests/test_gate_quest_card_victory_honesty.py`, 6 cases, fail-then-pass
proved by reintroducing the exact old heading live) protects the fix from
regressing. Also confirmed A3 and A4 already fully shipped under A5/A6's own
2026-09-08 commits, never marked against their own rows: A3's symptom
screen and A4's two-minute first-action override both live in
`site/assets/js/quest.js`, verified by reading the code directly. See
`PLAN-MICROZONES-DECKS-APP.md`'s M7/A1 rows and section 1.4 for the full
account.

# 21. Highest-Priority Next Actions

All required operating documents in `CLAUDE.md` section 56 now exist on disk;
the P1 through P6 "create the missing document" actions this section used to
list are done and have been removed. **Corrected 2026-09-08:** the
authoritative queue is now `BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md`, Phil's own reprioritisation
toward micro zones, decks and image/video work, which explicitly supersedes
the ordering (not the process rules) in `BACKLOG-2026-H2.md`. The P1 through P6
Phil-gated items below, carried from the 2026-09-02 review, were individually
re-checked against the 9 open GitHub issues this cycle and are still open and
still accurate; they are not the whole queue any more. Unblocked
operator-actionable work now lives in `BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md` sections 2
through 4 (app, decks, images/video), not in this list. `OWNER-ACTIONS.md`
remains the standing consolidated list of everything genuinely gated on Phil.
The consolidated list of Phil-gated items:

## P1: Umami read access (backlog 1.1) -- corrected 2026-09-02

Not fully blocked any more. Phil read the analytics database directly on
2026-09-02 (the API token is expired) and got a real one-time baseline, now
recorded in `GOALS.md` and above in section 9. What is still open is items
1.2 through 1.4: wiring a share URL or API key into `ops/dashboard.py` so a
credential-less operator session can pull fresh numbers itself, instead of
depending on Phil re-reading the database by hand each time the baseline
goes stale.

Owner: **Phil** for the credential/share-URL; **operator** for the wiring
once it exists.

---

## P2: Decide the Listmonk sending identity (issue #15, P0)

Separate Listmonk instance for 6S Success, or change the shared instance's
global from-address and accept the cost to the other brand it currently
serves (Compassion Benchmark). Blocks email capture entirely; six prospects
already lost with no way to reach them.

Owner: **Phil decides, operator builds**

---

## P3: Publish the ten LinkedIn posts and generate the six tier-0 images (backlog 3.1, 3.3)

Both already drafted/prompted and waiting in Phil's queue. The only traffic
lever available that does not require search compounding time.

Owner: **Phil**

---

## P4: Resolve the routine self-update gap (issue #17), CLOSED 2026-08-25

Phil's own session rewrote the trigger's stored prompt to read
`BACKLOG-2026-H2.md` and the other operating documents directly each cycle,
rather than embedding a status snapshot that only the trigger's creator could
refresh. The self-update limitation still exists as a platform fact, but the
prompt no longer depends on being edited to stay current, so the practical
defect is resolved.

Owner: closed, no further action

---

## P5: Approve a capped local demand test for the service SKUs (backlog 3B.1)

A financial commitment, correctly RED per `CLAUDE.md`. This is the only tested
route to $20,000 that does not require a quarter-million monthly visitors; the
recommendation on file is a few hundred dollars and a hard 90-day stop.

Owner: **Phil**

---

## P6a: Sync the 155-SKU product spine to Stripe (backlog 5.7), CLOSED 2026-08-27

Phil did both halves himself: commit `b10a278` extended `SELLABLE`, ran the
live Stripe sync, and wired the resulting payment links into
`window.CATALOG`. 158 of 159 catalog items are now buyable (only Corporate
Lean 6S is not). A same-day follow-up commit `3e5248c` also fixed
`ops/build_epub.py` reading a hardcoded author placeholder, which had
blocked Amazon KDP submission. `ops/audit_catalog.py` re-verified clean
this cycle against the live 159-SKU set.

Owner: closed, no further action

---

## P6: Stripe business website field still reads Ledgerium (backlog 2.8, issue #21)

Everything else on the account's public identity is already fixed per account
(name, statement descriptor, support email/URL, legal pages, checkout
branding). Only the business website field remains, and Stripe's own safety
check blocked the operator from changing it because it can silently change
the shared legal entity's other account (Ledgerium) too. This has been open
since 2026-08-21 and was on the auto-generated dashboard but missing from
this file and from `BACKLOG-2026-H2.md` until this cycle added it.

Owner: **Phil**

# 22. Agent Startup Checklist

Before significant autonomous work:

- [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Read `AUTONOMY.md`
- [ ] Read `STATUS.md`
- [ ] Identify owning agent
- [ ] Check active workstreams
- [ ] Check blockers
- [ ] Check risks
- [ ] Inspect real system state when relevant
- [ ] Classify action GREEN / YELLOW / RED
- [ ] Avoid duplicating active work

---

# 23. Status Update Rules

Update this file when any of the following materially changes:

- production health
- deployed release
- active major workstream
- incident state
- major blocker
- material risk
- executive priority
- live data confidence
- GitHub control-plane health
- VPS/Docker health
- backup/restore confidence
- major product launch state

Do not update it for every commit.

---

# 24. How to Update Status

For each changed section:

1. obtain evidence
2. change status
3. add concise evidence/notes
4. update timestamp
5. identify owner if action remains
6. move historical detail to the appropriate long-term file

Do not allow this document to become an archive.

---

# 25. Freshness

Operational status decays quickly.

Agents should treat old status as a hypothesis when the underlying system can be inspected.

For highly dynamic information such as:

- production health
- container health
- current release
- incidents
- active PRs
- traffic
- revenue

prefer live sources over stale Markdown.

Update this summary afterward.

---

# 26. Truth Hierarchy

When this file conflicts with verified live state:

**Verified live state wins.**

Then update this file.

When two live sources conflict:

1. identify authoritative source from `DATA-SOURCES.md`
2. investigate discrepancy
3. report confidence
4. do not fabricate reconciliation

---

# 27. Status Ownership

Each specialist maintains its domain truth.

`github-manager`
→ GitHub/release status

`vps-docker-manager`
→ Hostinger/Docker runtime status

`devops-sre`
→ reliability/incident status

`analytics-intelligence`
→ business/product measurement confidence

`seo-aeo`
→ organic discovery status

`commerce-manager`
→ commerce status

`product-manager`
→ customer/product journey status

`6s-ceo`
→ strategic priority and executive synthesis

# 28. Executive Escalation

Surface to the owner when:

- production is RED
- significant customer data is at risk
- payment integrity is at risk
- a RED authorization is required
- recovery capability is materially compromised
- a major strategic decision is blocked
- a material financial/legal commitment is required

Do not escalate routine GREEN work.

# 29. Desired Future State

This file should eventually be generated largely from trusted system state.

Target pattern:

**GitHub + VPS + Analytics + Commerce + Search + Product Events**
→ **Metrics / Status Collection**
→ **STATUS.md summary**
→ **Executive Dashboard**
→ **6s-ceo prioritization**
→ **BACKLOG.md**
→ **Autonomous execution**

Human edits should not be required for routine status maintenance.

# 30. Current Overall Assessment

**Operating System:** OPERATING, governance and required documents in place

**Governance:** STRONG FOUNDATION

**Autonomous Execution Readiness:** FULL FOR GREEN-BAND WORK. AS OF 2026-09-15, THE AUTHORITATIVE QUEUE IS `BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md`, NOT `BACKLOG-2026-H2.md` (SUPERSEDED ON ORDERING, SECTION 21 ABOVE). SECTIONS 2 THROUGH 6 OF THAT FILE ARE, AS OF THIS DATE, ALL EITHER DONE OR EXPLICITLY GATED ON PHIL (ALL 7 OPEN GITHUB ISSUES CARRY A `decision` OR `blocked-on-art` LABEL, DOWN FROM 8 AFTER #20 CLOSED AS SUPERSEDED, 2026-09-15). WHEN THAT IS TRUE, THE ESTABLISHED FALLBACK IS A COLD READ OF A LOW-MENTION `ops/*.py` FILE OR HAND-MAINTAINED DOCUMENT, VERIFIED AGAINST THE LIVE OR GENERATED ARTIFACT RATHER THAN TRUSTED ON SIGHT; MOST REAL DEFECTS FOUND THIS MONTH CAME FROM THAT PRACTICE, NOT FROM THE BACKLOG.

**Production Knowledge:** LAST CONFIRMED CURRENT 2026-09-15T21:13:31Z (build `c3d0d442441b24df`, `ops/deploy-verdict.json`, A LOCAL SESSION WITH REAL VPS ACCESS, COMMITTED IN `19b1e298` AFTER RUNNING `ops/deploy.py` AND VERIFYING SIX SAMPLED ZONE PAGES LIVE). THIS IS THE SAME BUILD `site/build-id.txt` CARRIES AS OF THIS ENTRY, SO PRODUCTION AND THE REPOSITORY MATCH. TWO EARLIER READINGS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE NOW SUPERSEDED: `346c043b56385f64` (11:17:08Z) AND `587d80befe8bd586` (16:47:49Z), THE LATTER DEPLOYED TO CARRY `8e7401b7`'S FIX (STORAGE PRODUCTS NO LONGER RECOMMENDED BEFORE SORT ON 115 ZONE PAGES) THAT HAD BUILT GREEN BUT SAT UNDEPLOYED FOR SEVERAL HOURS. NO OPERATOR SANDBOX HOLDS THE DEPLOY KEY'S PRIVATE HALF OR EGRESS TO THE VPS, SO NEITHER A FRESH CHECK NOR A REDEPLOY IS POSSIBLE FROM HERE; TREAT VPS ACCESS AS PER-SESSION, NOT UNIFORMLY AVAILABLE.

**Business Data Knowledge:** ONE MEASURED TRANSACTION EVER ($19 GROSS, 2026-08-21, A REFERRAL). CURRENT TRAFFIC BASELINE (`GOALS.md`, MEASURED 2026-09-14 21:30 BY A DIRECT UMAMI DATABASE READ FROM A SESSION HOLDING THE VPS KEY): 75 VISITORS ACROSS 196 VISITS AND 947 PAGEVIEWS IN 30 DAYS, OF WHICH 441 PAGEVIEWS CAME FROM 2 AUTOMATED SESSIONS, LEAVING 506 FROM 73 VISITORS. IN UMAMI `session_id` IS THE VISITOR AND PERSISTS ACROSS DAYS, THE VISIT IS `visit_id`. STRANGERS' BUY-CLICKS SINCE 7 SEPT: 0 (`LEARNINGS.md` LRN-0010). THE EMAIL LIST IS READABLE, NOT UNREADABLE, AND MEASURED EMPTY: 0 SUBSCRIBERS (ISSUE #15, STILL UNRESOLVED, BLOCKS CAPTURE ENTIRELY).

**Executive Visibility:** LIVE, VIA `EXECUTIVE-DASHBOARD-LIVE.md` (GENERATED BY `ops/dashboard.py`, NOT HAND-TYPED)

**Immediate Focus:** UNCHANGED IN SUBSTANCE SINCE 2026-09-02, RE-CONFIRMED 2026-09-15: TRAFFIC, NOT ANALYTICS OR TECHNICAL DEBT, IS THE CONSTRAINT (`GOALS.md`). 2.5 VISITORS A DAY. THE CHANNELS THAT COULD CHANGE THAT (VIDEO PLATFORMS, LINKEDIN, PINTEREST, INSTAGRAM) NEED ACCOUNTS ONLY PHIL CAN CREATE (`OWNER-ACTIONS.md`); DISTRIBUTION PREP IS READY AND WAITING (114 ZONES OF VIDEO IN MULTIPLE CUTS, PINTEREST/INSTAGRAM CARDS FOR ALL 114 ZONES, ~4,408 READY-TO-PUBLISH SOCIAL UNITS TOTAL). SIX INDEPENDENT REVIEWS THIS WEEK FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL DEBT; THE DOMINANT DEFECT CLASS FOUND INSTEAD IS A CORRECTED SOURCE WHOSE SHIPPED ARTIFACT WAS NEVER RE-DERIVED (`BACKLOG-2026-09-07.md` SECTION 7). THE HONEST STATE OF THIS BUSINESS IS "COMMERCE WORKS, TRAFFIC IS MEASURED AND NEARLY ALL DIRECT, PRODUCTION IS CURRENT, AND THE NEXT STEP ON EVERY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS PHIL'S OWN ACTION."

# Final Rule

`STATUS.md` must describe reality, not aspiration.

If something is unknown, write `UNKNOWN`.

If something is degraded, write `YELLOW`.

If something is broken, write `RED`.

If something is healthy, prove it.

The purpose of this file is to let every autonomous agent answer:

**Where are we now, what matters most, and what should happen next?**
