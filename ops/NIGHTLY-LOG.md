**Did:** Closed the website half of the P0 list. Built privacy, terms,
accessibility and safety-notice pages and wired them into all 13 pages, taking
dead links from 24 to 0. Injected the safety disclaimer estate-wide: 50/50
chapters, the Field Manual, decks, board games, appendix and app. Corrected the
chapter count from thirty to fifty and relabelled the download, which claims to
be the complete book but is chapters 1 to 30.

**Verified:** Served the site locally and loaded every new page in a browser.
Confirmed Fraunces 600 now loads as a real weight, and that the site makes zero
third-party requests.

**Found:** The site had the same faux-bold bug the book had, 22 font rules all
pointing at eight weight-400 files. Fixed by installing the 14 missing weights.
`invest.html` was the only page still calling a font CDN, which leaked visitor
IPs to Google. Now self-hosted.

**Next:** The nightly loop cannot start until the GitHub account is connected
for cloud routines. See `LOOP.md`. After that, the money path: connect the nine
dead forms to an email service.
