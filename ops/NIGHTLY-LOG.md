## 2026-08-16 (setup pass, run by Claude with Phil awake)

**Did:** Closed the website half of the P0 list. Built privacy, terms,
accessibility and safety-notice pages and wired them into all 13 pages, taking
dead links from 24 to 0. Injected the safety disclaimer estate-wide: 50/50
chapters, the Field Manual, decks, board games, appendix and app. Corrected the
chapter count from thirty to fifty and relabelled the download, which claims to
be the complete book but is chapters 1 to 30.

**Verified:** Served the site locally and loaded every new page in a browser.
Confirmed Fraunces 600 now loads as a real weight, and that the site makes zero
third-party requests.

**Found:** The site had the same faux-bold bug the book had, 22 font rules all
pointing at eight weight-400 files. Fixed by installing the 14 missing weights.
`invest.html` was the only page still calling a font CDN, which leaked visitor
IPs to Google. Now self-hosted.

**Next:** The nightly loop cannot start until the GitHub account is connected
for cloud routines. See `LOOP.md`. After that, the money path: connect the nine
dead forms to an email service.

## 2026-08-17 (money-path pass)

**Did:** Gave the book an exit door. It contained zero URLs and zero mentions of
6s-success.com across all 50 manuscripts and all 50 chapter HTML files, so
233,000 words of demand generation sent the reader nowhere. Built
`site/resources.html`, generated from the same 114-zone source the book uses, one
anchor per room, then added a companion link to all 50 chapters pointing at their
own room's anchor. Method chapters point at the page root.

**Verified:** 20 sections, 20 table-of-contents links, all resolving. Rendered in
a browser. Zero em or en dashes in the page or in any of the 50 inserted blocks.
Spot-checked anchors for chapters 12, 31, 45 and 50.

**Found and fixed two things that would have shipped broken.** The page used the
Manual's zone names, but the book renames seven zones, so a reader holding both
would have seen two names for one zone. It now reads names from the chapter
manuscripts. And nginx used `try_files $uri $uri/`, which would have 404'd the
short `/resources` URL printed in all 50 chapters. Now tries `$uri.html`.

**Next:** Still no email capture, so the resources page cannot convert a reader
into a contact. That is the next money-path step and it needs an email provider
account.

## 2026-08-17 (four-agent parallel pass)

**Did:** Ran four specialist agents on disjoint paths. Shipped an **EPUB** of all
50 chapters (0.67 MB, deterministic, 55 spine items, 0 dashes, all 50 safety
notices intact) and reconstructed **Chapter 1's missing manuscript**, the one
chapter that could not previously be rebuilt from source. Prepared the **Micro
Zone Manual for print** at 7x10 with real print CSS and rebuilt its appendix from
97 to the current 123 product types. Wrote **7 missing control documents** and
proved 8 others were redundant rather than writing them. Ran an **SEO pass**:
robots, sitemap, canonicals, 18 valid JSON-LD blocks, and the rooms page went
from 13 inbound links to 66.

**Verified:** 14/14 pages return 200, 18/18 JSON-LD blocks parse, 0 em and 0 en
dashes across the site, EPUB zip structure checked independently of the agent
that built it.

**Found:** The SEO agent removed a **fabricated testimonial** ("Dana R.") and two
unsupported badges ("Bestseller", "Most popular") from the live site. It also
found `--rule`, a CSS variable used by five pages but never defined, so those
borders silently never rendered.

**The uncomfortable one:** the control layer carries **457 em dashes and 42 en
dashes** across 65 files while the published site carries zero. The documents
that enforce the house style are the only ones breaking it, and agents read them
as authority. Now measured on the dashboard.

**Next:** money path still blocked on an email provider. GitHub connection still
500s, so the nightly loop cannot be created yet.

## 2026-08-17 (cover and packaging pass)

**Did:** Finished the half-built cover work the previous pass left in the tree.
The EPUB now carries a cover: `ops/build_cover.py` generates a 1600x2560
typographic cover from the book's own design system, and `ops/build_epub.py`
embeds it as the first spine item with both the EPUB 3 `cover-image` property and
the EPUB 2 `meta name="cover"` that KDP and Kobo still read. Rebuilt: 32 of 32
gates pass, 56 spine items, zero em and en dashes. Also ran the Micro Zone Manual
gates after the print work: all pass, 20 rooms, 114 zones.

**Verified:** Opened the zip independently of the builder and confirmed the cover
image, the cover page and all four OPF declarations. Rendered the cover and
looked at it.

**Found and fixed three things.** The tree did not build at all: the cover code
referenced `ROOT`, which does not exist in that file. The cover used the general
palette rather than the site's per-S ramp, so **Safety was blue on the cover and
amber everywhere else**. And the dashboard's "can the site take money" was
`... and False`, a hardcoded NO wearing the costume of a measurement, which would
have kept saying NO on the day a checkout went live. It now looks for a real
payment processor.

**New on the dashboard:** a "Book, sellable?" row. It reads **NO**. The manuscript
is finished and packaged, but 13 front-matter fields are still bracketed, so
there is no byline and no copyright holder. That is issue #3, and it is the only
thing between the book and a retailer.

**Next:** money path unchanged, still no email capture and no processor.

## 2026-08-17 17:54 (cycle 1 of the four-hour loop)

**Did:** Took the defect the last retro called "the uncomfortable one". The
control layer carried 483 em dashes and 53 en dashes while the published estate
carried zero, so the documents that tell every agent the house style were the
only ones breaking it, and agents read them as authority. Built
`ops/fix_dashes.py` and converted all 536 across 52 files. Also stood up the
four-hour cloud routine and gave the command deck a real redesign.

**Verified:** `python ops/fix_dashes.py --check` reports the control layer clean.
`git diff --numstat` shows 535 added and 535 removed with added equal to removed
in every file, so nothing but punctuation moved. Dashboard now measures 0 em, 0
en. Book gates 32 of 32, Manual gates all pass.

**Went well:** Previewing the substitution before applying it. The first pass
classified 10 conversions as prose commas. Reading all 10 showed every one was a
label the classifier had missed, not prose. Had that run unreviewed it would have
put commas in 10 places a colon belonged. Preview, sample, then apply is the
habit worth keeping.

**Did not go well:** The classifier needed three corrections found only by
reading output: list markers on identifier labels, emphasis that wraps the whole
line rather than the label, and table cells where a lone dash means not
applicable. Writing the rules from a sample of six examples was too few. Also
inherited a tree that did not build, because a previous pass left a `ROOT`
symbol referenced but never defined.

**Changing next cycle:** Never apply a bulk text transform without first printing
every case of the minority class. The majority class is where the confidence is
and the minority class is where the errors are. And run the build before starting
new work, not after, so an inherited breakage is found in the first minute.

**Next:** The money path is still the constraint and still needs an email
provider. Front matter (#3) is the cheapest revenue unblock and needs Phil.

## 2026-08-18 08:30 (loop repair, run from the desk)

**Did:** Found the four-hour loop had fired four times overnight and committed
nothing. Every run did good work and then hung. Root cause: step 6 told it to
republish the hosted command deck, and the Artifact tool needs an interactive
approval that a headless cloud session cannot grant. All four sat on that
permission prompt until the run was abandoned, so steps 7 and 8, the
retrospective and the commit, were never reached. Rewrote the routine prompt and
saved it to `ops/routine-prompt.md` so it is reviewable in the repository rather
than only in the cloud.

**Verified:** `RemoteTrigger list_runs` shows all four runs `requires_action`.
`git log HEAD..origin/main` is empty, confirming nothing was pushed. The 12:50
run log shows all four gates passing and a real site change made and tested in a
headless browser, then the hang.

**Went well:** The runs themselves were good. The 12:50 one ran every gate first,
found the tree clean, tested its change in a real browser with a screenshot,
caught its own em dash, and diffed the EPUB byte change down to the build
timestamp before accepting it. The nine-step prompt is working. It just could not
finish.

**Did not go well:** I wrote that step. I gave a headless agent an instruction
that requires a human to click. Four cycles of work lost to one line I did not
think through.

**Changing next cycle:** Before putting any tool call in an unattended prompt,
ask whether it can complete with nobody watching. Added step 0, attach to main,
because the checkout arrives detached, and told it plainly that gh is absent so
UNKNOWN issue counts are correct rather than a bug to chase.

**Next:** 6s-success.com serves a Hostinger parking page. Nothing built so far is
reachable by anyone. Deployment is now second in the priority list, behind only
the money path.
