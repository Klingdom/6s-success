## 2026-08-16 (setup pass, run by Claude with Phil awake)

**Did:** Closed the website half of the P0 list. Built privacy, terms,
accessibility and safety-notice pages and wired them into all 13 pages, taking
dead links from 24 to 0. Injected the safety disclaimer estate-wide: 50/50
chapters, the Field Manual, decks, board games, appendix and app. Corrected the
chapter count from thirty to fifty and relabelled the download, which claims to
be the complete book but is chapters 1 to 30.

**Verified:** Served the site locally and loaded every new page in a browser.
Confirmed Fraunces 600 now loads as a real weight, and that the site makes zero
third-party requests.

**Found:** The site had the same faux-bold bug the book had, 22 font rules all
pointing at eight weight-400 files. Fixed by installing the 14 missing weights.
`invest.html` was the only page still calling a font CDN, which leaked visitor
IPs to Google. Now self-hosted.

**Next:** The nightly loop cannot start until the GitHub account is connected
for cloud routines. See `LOOP.md`. After that, the money path: connect the nine
dead forms to an email service.

## 2026-08-17 (money-path pass)

**Did:** Gave the book an exit door. It contained zero URLs and zero mentions of
6s-success.com across all 50 manuscripts and all 50 chapter HTML files, so
233,000 words of demand generation sent the reader nowhere. Built
`site/resources.html`, generated from the same 114-zone source the book uses, one
anchor per room, then added a companion link to all 50 chapters pointing at their
own room's anchor. Method chapters point at the page root.

**Verified:** 20 sections, 20 table-of-contents links, all resolving. Rendered in
a browser. Zero em or en dashes in the page or in any of the 50 inserted blocks.
Spot-checked anchors for chapters 12, 31, 45 and 50.

**Found and fixed two things that would have shipped broken.** The page used the
Manual's zone names, but the book renames seven zones, so a reader holding both
would have seen two names for one zone. It now reads names from the chapter
manuscripts. And nginx used `try_files $uri $uri/`, which would have 404'd the
short `/resources` URL printed in all 50 chapters. Now tries `$uri.html`.

**Next:** Still no email capture, so the resources page cannot convert a reader
into a contact. That is the next money-path step and it needs an email provider
account.
