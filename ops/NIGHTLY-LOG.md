## 2026-08-16 (setup pass, run by Claude with Phil awake)

**Did:** Closed the website half of the P0 list. Built privacy, terms,
accessibility and safety-notice pages and wired them into all 13 pages, taking
dead links from 24 to 0. Injected the safety disclaimer estate-wide: 50/50
chapters, the Field Manual, decks, board games, appendix and app. Corrected the
chapter count from thirty to fifty and relabelled the download, which claims to
be the complete book but is chapters 1 to 30.

**Verified:** Served the site locally and loaded every new page in a browser.
Confirmed Fraunces 600 now loads as a real weight, and that the site makes zero
third-party requests.

**Found:** The site had the same faux-bold bug the book had, 22 font rules all
pointing at eight weight-400 files. Fixed by installing the 14 missing weights.
`invest.html` was the only page still calling a font CDN, which leaked visitor
IPs to Google. Now self-hosted.

**Next:** The nightly loop cannot start until the GitHub account is connected
for cloud routines. See `LOOP.md`. After that, the money path: connect the nine
dead forms to an email service.

---

## 2026-08-17 (money-path pass)

**Did:** Gave the book an exit door. It contained zero URLs and zero mentions of
6s-success.com across all 50 manuscripts and all 50 chapter HTML files, so
233,000 words of demand generation sent the reader nowhere. Built
`site/resources.html`, generated from the same 114-zone source the book uses, one
anchor per room, then added a companion link to all 50 chapters pointing at their
own room's anchor. Method chapters point at the page root.

**Verified:** 20 sections, 20 table-of-contents links, all resolving. Rendered in
a browser. Zero em or en dashes in the page or in any of the 50 inserted blocks.
Spot-checked anchors for chapters 12, 31, 45 and 50.

**Found and fixed two things that would have shipped broken.** The page used the
Manual's zone names, but the book renames seven zones, so a reader holding both
would have seen two names for one zone. It now reads names from the chapter
manuscripts. And nginx used `try_files $uri $uri/`, which would have 404'd the
short `/resources` URL printed in all 50 chapters. Now tries `$uri.html`.

**Next:** Still no email capture, so the resources page cannot convert a reader
into a contact. That is the next money-path step and it needs an email provider
account.

---

## 2026-08-17 (four-agent parallel pass)

**Did:** Ran four specialist agents on disjoint paths. Shipped an **EPUB** of all
50 chapters (0.67 MB, deterministic, 55 spine items, 0 dashes, all 50 safety
notices intact) and reconstructed **Chapter 1's missing manuscript**, the one
chapter that could not previously be rebuilt from source. Prepared the **Micro
Zone Manual for print** at 7x10 with real print CSS and rebuilt its appendix from
97 to the current 123 product types. Wrote **7 missing control documents** and
proved 8 others were redundant rather than writing them. Ran an **SEO pass**:
robots, sitemap, canonicals, 18 valid JSON-LD blocks, and the rooms page went
from 13 inbound links to 66.

**Verified:** 14/14 pages return 200, 18/18 JSON-LD blocks parse, 0 em and 0 en
dashes across the site, EPUB zip structure checked independently of the agent
that built it.

**Found:** The SEO agent removed a **fabricated testimonial** ("Dana R.") and two
unsupported badges ("Bestseller", "Most popular") from the live site. It also
found `--rule`, a CSS variable used by five pages but never defined, so those
borders silently never rendered.

**The uncomfortable one:** the control layer carries **457 em dashes and 42 en
dashes** across 65 files while the published site carries zero. The documents
that enforce the house style are the only ones breaking it, and agents read them
as authority. Now measured on the dashboard.

**Next:** money path still blocked on an email provider. GitHub connection still
500s, so the nightly loop cannot be created yet.

---

## 2026-08-17 (cover and packaging pass)

**Did:** Finished the half-built cover work the previous pass left in the tree.
The EPUB now carries a cover: `ops/build_cover.py` generates a 1600x2560
typographic cover from the book's own design system, and `ops/build_epub.py`
embeds it as the first spine item with both the EPUB 3 `cover-image` property and
the EPUB 2 `meta name="cover"` that KDP and Kobo still read. Rebuilt: 32 of 32
gates pass, 56 spine items, zero em and en dashes. Also ran the Micro Zone Manual
gates after the print work: all pass, 20 rooms, 114 zones.

**Verified:** Opened the zip independently of the builder and confirmed the cover
image, the cover page and all four OPF declarations. Rendered the cover and
looked at it.

**Found and fixed three things.** The tree did not build at all: the cover code
referenced `ROOT`, which does not exist in that file. The cover used the general
palette rather than the site's per-S ramp, so **Safety was blue on the cover and
amber everywhere else**. And the dashboard's "can the site take money" was
`... and False`, a hardcoded NO wearing the costume of a measurement, which would
have kept saying NO on the day a checkout went live. It now looks for a real
payment processor.

**New on the dashboard:** a "Book, sellable?" row. It reads **NO**. The manuscript
is finished and packaged, but 13 front-matter fields are still bracketed, so
there is no byline and no copyright holder. That is issue #3, and it is the only
thing between the book and a retailer.

**Next:** money path unchanged, still no email capture and no processor.

---

## 2026-08-17 17:54 (cycle 1 of the four-hour loop)

**Did:** Took the defect the last retro called "the uncomfortable one". The
control layer carried 483 em dashes and 53 en dashes while the published estate
carried zero, so the documents that tell every agent the house style were the
only ones breaking it, and agents read them as authority. Built
`ops/fix_dashes.py` and converted all 536 across 52 files. Also stood up the
four-hour cloud routine and gave the command deck a real redesign.

**Verified:** `python ops/fix_dashes.py --check` reports the control layer clean.
`git diff --numstat` shows 535 added and 535 removed with added equal to removed
in every file, so nothing but punctuation moved. Dashboard now measures 0 em, 0
en. Book gates 32 of 32, Manual gates all pass.

**Went well:** Previewing the substitution before applying it. The first pass
classified 10 conversions as prose commas. Reading all 10 showed every one was a
label the classifier had missed, not prose. Had that run unreviewed it would have
put commas in 10 places a colon belonged. Preview, sample, then apply is the
habit worth keeping.

**Did not go well:** The classifier needed three corrections found only by
reading output: list markers on identifier labels, emphasis that wraps the whole
line rather than the label, and table cells where a lone dash means not
applicable. Writing the rules from a sample of six examples was too few. Also
inherited a tree that did not build, because a previous pass left a `ROOT`
symbol referenced but never defined.

**Changing next cycle:** Never apply a bulk text transform without first printing
every case of the minority class. The majority class is where the confidence is
and the minority class is where the errors are. And run the build before starting
new work, not after, so an inherited breakage is found in the first minute.

**Next:** The money path is still the constraint and still needs an email
provider. Front matter (#3) is the cheapest revenue unblock and needs Phil.

## 2026-08-18 08:30 (loop repair, run from the desk)

**Did:** Found the four-hour loop had fired four times overnight and committed
nothing. Every run did good work and then hung. Root cause: step 6 told it to
republish the hosted command deck, and the Artifact tool needs an interactive
approval that a headless cloud session cannot grant. All four sat on that
permission prompt until the run was abandoned, so steps 7 and 8, the
retrospective and the commit, were never reached. Rewrote the routine prompt and
saved it to `ops/routine-prompt.md` so it is reviewable in the repository rather
than only in the cloud.

**Verified:** `RemoteTrigger list_runs` shows all four runs `requires_action`.
`git log HEAD..origin/main` is empty, confirming nothing was pushed. The 12:50
run log shows all four gates passing and a real site change made and tested in a
headless browser, then the hang.

**Went well:** The runs themselves were good. The 12:50 one ran every gate first,
found the tree clean, tested its change in a real browser with a screenshot,
caught its own em dash, and diffed the EPUB byte change down to the build
timestamp before accepting it. The nine-step prompt is working. It just could not
finish.

**Did not go well:** I wrote that step. I gave a headless agent an instruction
that requires a human to click. Four cycles of work lost to one line I did not
think through.

**Changing next cycle:** Before putting any tool call in an unattended prompt,
ask whether it can complete with nobody watching. Added step 0, attach to main,
because the checkout arrives detached, and told it plainly that gh is absent so
UNKNOWN issue counts are correct rather than a bug to chase.

**Next:** 6s-success.com serves a Hostinger parking page. Nothing built so far is
reachable by anyone. Deployment is now second in the priority list, behind only
the money path.

---

## 2026-08-18 09:06 (forms pass, run from the desk)

**Did:** Made all 14 site forms do something. The 13 footer newsletter forms
accepted an address, discarded it, and gave no feedback at all, which is the
worst option because the reader believes they subscribed. They now say the list
is not connected and hand over a prefilled message so the person can be added in
one click. The contact form showed "Thanks" for a message it threw away; it now
says plainly that nothing has been sent and packs the name, email, topic and
message into a mailto so one more click delivers it.

**Verified:** Drove both forms in a real browser. Empty, malformed and valid
paths on the newsletter; empty and filled on contact; confirmed the mailto
carries the typed name, address, topic and message with real line breaks, that
focus moves to the link, and that the page does not scroll sideways. All four
gates pass and the site carries zero em and en dashes.

**Went well:** Testing in a browser rather than reading the diff. Nothing else
would have found either defect below.

**Did not go well:** I shipped a syntax error. My escaped newlines became literal
ones, leaving an unterminated string that killed the whole inline script block on
contact.html, including the pre-existing product prefill that had nothing to do
with my change. I also wrote CSS that lost a specificity fight with
`.site-footer .brand-col p` and silently rendered at the wrong size, twice,
because my first fix was still one class too weak.

**Changing next cycle:** When generating code through a Python here-doc, write it
in a raw string. Both defects were invisible in the diff and obvious in the
browser within seconds.

**Next:** Deployment. The domain is still parked.

---

## 2026-08-18 10:05 (sample PDF pass, run from the desk)

**Did:** Cut the free sample PDF from 50.7 MB to 40.0 MB with no loss of quality,
and corrected a claim it was making about itself. Five images had been stored in
a lossless format built for line art rather than for photographs, costing 8.7 MB
between them; re-encoding at identical pixel dimensions reclaimed 7.4 MB. The
sample also called itself "The Complete Book" while holding chapters 1 to 30 of
50, in the PDF metadata and twice in the HTML twin. Fixed in all three.

**Verified:** Page count identical at 492. Text extraction identical across 15
sampled pages. All 173 images still present and decodable. Measured the pixel
difference on every converted image, worst case a mean of 2.09 out of 255, and
looked at that worst case side by side with the original: no visible difference.
Served the file and opened it in a browser, where it renders and reports the
corrected title.

**Went well:** Measuring before deciding. The instinct was to recompress
everything; measurement showed the 168 JPEGs would give back only 6 percent while
adding a generation of loss, so they were left alone. The whole win came from 5
files.

**Did not go well:** I nearly committed a 50 MB backup copy. The file is tracked,
so git history already holds the original and the backup was pure waste. Caught
it in git status, not by thinking.

**Changing next cycle:** Before writing a backup, ask whether version control
already holds it. Now gitignored and documented in the script.

**Next:** The sample is still 89 percent of the deployable site. Going below
40 MB trades image quality, which is a product call, so issue #14 puts the
measured options in front of Phil rather than degrading the product quietly.

---

## 2026-08-18 (autonomous operator pass)

**Did:** Checkout landed detached, five commits ahead of the branch. Fast
forwarded main and pushed; a fetch showed origin already had them, nothing lost,
only the local branch pointer was stale. Fixed a money path bug: the cart's
"Request invoice" button links to contact.html?ref=cart, but the prefill only
looked up a single SKU, so ref=cart matched nothing and handed the customer an
empty message box. A filled cart now arrives itemised with subtotal, and the
mailto carries the same detail. Also corrected two stale STATUS.md claims,
disconnected forms and unverified deploy, both fixed by earlier passes today.

**Verified:** Drove it in a headless browser: added two catalogue items, clicked
cart to contact, confirmed prefill and topic, submitted, checked the mailto body
matched. Confirmed single-SKU quote links still work and an empty cart leaves
the message blank. All four gates pass.

**Went well:** Verifying with a fetch instead of assuming the detached commits
needed rescuing, proving no harm was done rather than just hoping.

**Did not go well:** Close call: had those commits not been on origin, the
checkout warning was the only thing between real work and permanent loss.

**Changing next cycle:** When instructions name a specific failure mode, verify
the actual state rather than assume it does not apply this time.

**Next:** Deployment stays blocked on issue #13, a VPS deploy key, needing
Phil's hands on the host. Until then, audit the site for the same defect class:
a handoff that looks connected but does nothing.

---

## 2026-08-18 11:40 (mail credential and a pricing defect, run from the desk)

**Did:** Two things. Phil supplied an app password for support@6s-success.com, so
the morning brief is now delivered rather than fetched: `ops/mailer.py` sends as
support@, `ops/send_brief.py` renders `ops/state.json` as a plain text and html
email and refuses to send if that state is over 12 hours old. Then, verifying the
cloud run's cart handoff, found a pricing misrepresentation and fixed it.

**Verified:** Authenticated on 465 and 587, sent the brief to support@, then read
the mailbox back over IMAP and confirmed the delivered Message-ID matched the one
SMTP returned with both parts intact. For the cart, drove a four item order
through the browser and read what the customer would actually send.

**Found:** `Cart.add` stored `price: p.price || 0`, which turned a null price into
zero, and `money(0)` renders "Free". So a corporate consulting engagement was
being offered as **Free** in the cart, in the drawer, and in the email the
customer sends, while the subtotal silently excluded it. The catalogue has both a
genuinely free item and a quote only item, so the distinction is real and was
being destroyed on the way into storage. Quote items now read "price on request"
and totals say "plus items we quote".

**Went well:** Not trusting the cloud run's work because it was well written. It
was well written, and it faithfully carried a defect that predated it.

**Did not go well:** Chrome served a cached `site.js` for three test rounds and I
read "not a function" as my own bug before checking. Also spent two failed
attempts patching a file by exact string match when the escaping made it fragile.

**Changing next cycle:** Hard reload before concluding a change did not take, and
patch by line predicate rather than by long exact strings.

**Next:** The credential unlocks a real form endpoint on the VPS, which would
capture a list without any third party. Blocked on deployment, issue #13.

---

## 2026-08-18 12:00 (deploy pipeline, run from the desk)

**Did:** Answered "how do I connect Docker to the private GitHub repo" by
removing the question. The host now pulls a published image rather than cloning
source, so no deploy key sits on the VPS and no token gets pasted into the
Hostinger panel. Built the Action, the compose file to paste, `DEPLOY-VPS.md`,
and `ops/verify_deploy.py`. Generated two SSH keypairs so no private half ever
crosses a chat.

**Verified:** The image built and published on the second attempt. Confirmed by
querying the registry directly rather than trusting the green tick: an anonymous
pull returns 403, which proves the package is still private and is exactly the
one step the deploy doc says Phil must do.

**Went well:** Running the verifier against the live parked domain before
trusting it. It scored 7 of 10, passing every page and asset check while failing
the three that test reality. That is the proof the tool works: a status-code-only
checker would have called a parked domain a healthy website.

**Did not go well:** The first Action run failed. I wrote `cache-to: type=gha`
without `docker/setup-buildx-action`, so buildx ran on the default docker driver
which cannot export a cache. Written from memory rather than checked.

**Changing next cycle:** When writing CI from memory, run it before saying it is
ready. The feedback loop is 40 seconds and I skipped it.

**Next:** Three panel clicks are now the only thing between the estate and being
reachable, listed at the bottom of DEPLOY-VPS.md. Stripe cannot be wired until
the site is actually served.

---

## 2026-08-18 (DNS diagnosis, run from the desk)

**Did:** Phil reported nginx and umami were configured for the domain on the VPS.
Checked, and the domain never reaches the VPS at all. Added a Host header
override to `ops/verify_deploy.py` so a virtual host can be proved correct
against a raw IP before any DNS record is touched.

**Verified:** `6s-success.com` and `www` both resolve to `2.57.91.91`, which
returns the Hostinger parking page **even when sent `Host: 6s-success.com`**. The
nameservers are still `aster` and `helios.dns-parking.com`. So the domain is on
parking nameservers and no record points at the VPS. Whatever is configured there
is correct and unreachable.

**Also found:** Phil flipped the **repository** public, not the **package**. They
are separate settings. The anonymous image pull still returns 403, so the deploy
is still blocked, and meanwhile 3,554 files including all 50 unpublished book
chapters and the strategy documents became publicly readable. Raised with him
immediately. No credential was exposed: nothing key shaped is tracked and the
tracked `.env` holds only DOMAIN and ACME_EMAIL.

**Did not go well:** I broke `verify_deploy.py` twice while adding six lines to
it, both times because escaped newlines in a generated patch became literal ones.
**I wrote a retro rule about this exact defect one cycle ago and then repeated
it.** The file did not parse for three attempts.

**Changing next cycle:** The rule was right and I ignored it, so the rule is not
the fix. From now on, any generated Python patch is followed immediately by
`python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open(f).read())"` in the same command, so a
broken file cannot survive the tool call that created it.

**Next:** Still the VPS public IP. Nothing about deployment can proceed without it.
